Before running both SOLDIER ROSTER SYSTEM and OES Applications the program you will need to run first is AccessDataBaseEngine since 
the both programs database is the MS Access For both softwares to work. UNZIP all files and save it into your desire locations in 
your computer. 

SOLDIER ROSTER SYSTEM INSTUCTIONS!!
*****NOTE*********
To run the executable file go to where you saved the folder then
SoldierRosterSystem>SoldierRorsterSystem>bin>Debug and run the SoldierRosterSystem.exe
The program is password protected.
The username is: admin
The username is: Pa$$w0rd
If you would like to see the MS Database design go to
SoldierRosterSystem>SoldierRosterSystem>Soldier Roster.accdb


The Golden Rule Member Tracking MS Access is a stand alone database. It was my first experiment working with MS Acess. 


OES Windwows Application form!!
*****NOTE*********
Again UNZIP the file and save it to your computer. Open the OES folder>OES Folder>Bin>Debug>Run OES.EXE
If you are trying to view reports, that functionality is not working properly. But, if you would like to see
how it works, the Soldier Roster System works fine. 
Once you run the OES.EXE program it will start with username and password
UserName: as
Password: as
If you would like to see the MS Database design go to
OES>OES>OES.accdb

Both Application, SOLDIER ROSTER SYSTEM and OES, databases are created using MS ACCESS
